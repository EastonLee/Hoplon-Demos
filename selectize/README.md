# hoplon-selectize

This project demonstrates the creation and use of a custom `selectize`
element backed by the
[selectize.js](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/) jQuery
plugin.

The `selectize` element is used to search for movies by title on
[Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/) with their
[Movies Search API](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs/read/json/v10/Movies_Search).
